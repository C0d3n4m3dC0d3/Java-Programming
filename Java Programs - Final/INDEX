Topic: Basics
       1. Hello World Program

Topic: Strings
       1. Creation of Strings:
          Using constructor
          Using Literal
       2. String class Methods:


       3. StringBuffer class Methods:


Topic: Abstract Class
       A. Need to do (not done yet; only read):
          abstract class with abstract method only
          abstract class with abstract and non-abstract methods
          abstract class with public static final data members only
          abstract class with default method

Topic: Inheritance
       A. Need to do (not done yet; only read):
          Simple Inheritance
          Multilevel Inheritance
          Hierarchical Inheritance
          Method Overriding
          super keyword
          final keyword
          static keyword

       B. done
          1. Dynamic Method Dispatch
          2. Calling superclass constructor by default (Super.java)

Topic: Interface
       A. Need to do (not done yet; only read):
          Multilevel Inheritance

Topic: Exception Handling
       A. Need to do (not done yet; only read):
          Exception occurs without Handling
          Exception handled using try-catch
          try-finally
            with exceptions, no handling
            without exceptions
            with exception, handling
          try-catch-finally
          nested try-catch
          throw exception
          throws - declare exception
          throw - custome/user defined exception

Topic: Threads
       1. Creation of Threads:
            By extending Thread Class (Thread0.java)
            By implementing Runnable Interface (Thread1.java)
       2. Putting a thread to sleep (Thread2.java)
       3. Joining a Thread to another (Thread3.java)
       4. Thread Priority
       5. Naming Threads

Topic:  APPLET PROGRAMMING
        1. Simple applet program to print "Hello World!" (SimpleApplet.java)
        2. Simple applet program to change and initialise string values by passing Parameters (AppletParam.java)
        3. ActionListener (AppletEvent.java)

Topic: AWT
       1. Implementing listener #1 [Key Listener] (KeyListens.java)
       2. Implementing listener #2 [Action Listener] (Actions.java)
       3. Implementing listener #3 [Mouse Listener] (Mousey.java)
       4. Implementing listener #4 [Mouse Motion Listener] (MouseyMoves.java)
       5.
